# Fertiliser Problem
Computes for the amount of fertiliser to be used. 


# Problem Description

A farmer needs to select fertiliser for her crops. She has access to two different types of fertiliser. Type A
contains 30% nitrogen and 20% phosphate. Type B contains 10% nitrogen and 40% phosphate. Supposing
that a particular crop needs n kilograms of nitrogen in total, and p kilograms of phosphate in total, how
many kilograms of each type of fertiliser are required?
Your solution should work with different types of fertiliser with different amounts of nitrogen and phosphate
(but only two types at a time) and different crop requirements.
Your implementation should be a function fertiliser(an, ap, bn, bp, n, p) where:
• an is the amount of nitrogen in 1kg of type A fertiliser
• ap is the amount of phosphate in 1kg of type A fertiliser
• bn is the amount of nitrogen in 1kg of type B fertiliser
• bp is the amount of phosphate in 1kg of type B fertiliser

• n is the amount of nitrogen required by the crop
• p is the amount of phosphate required by the crop


Your function should return a pair (a,b) where a is the amount of fertiliser of type A required, and b is the
amount of fertiliser of type B required. All amounts of fertiliser and nutrients are measured in kg. If there is
no solution to the problem your function should instead return None. Note that in this scenario, the farmer
cannot add a negative amount of fertiliser to her field, so if a or b is negative then that does not count as a
solution to the problem. Likewise, all the arguments to the function will make sense physically, i.e. they will
all be non-negative. Mathematically, it is possible for there to be an infinite number of solutions, but this is
beyond what we studied in the unit, so such cases can be ignored; they will not be used as test cases
